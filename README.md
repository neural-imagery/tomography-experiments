* `recon_2obj` includes **TOAST++** simulation code for a simple 2D reconstruction for both continuous wave (CW) and time-domain (TD) fNIRS systems.
* `fmri2fnirs` includes a pipeline for turning fMRI data into pseudo-fNIRS data. We apply it to the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) for `1pt0` resolution and for sessions `21` to `30` since these contain resting-state fMRI data.
